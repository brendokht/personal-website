Hello, my name is Brenden Kohut, I am an aspiring Full-stack developer, based in
London, Ontario, Canada. I am a recent graduate of Fanshawe College for
an advanced diploma in Computer Programming and Analysis. I am a hard-working and
high-drive individual who loves to learn and improve my programming abilities.

## Skills

Throughout my time at Fanshawe College, I learned various programming languages,
frameworks and tools, and have also built up my soft skills such as complex
problem solving, time management, etc. Here is a list of some of my strongest skills.

## Experience

While at Fanshawe, I was lucky enough to gain 4 months of hands-on experience doing a co-op
at _Infostructure Technology Inc._ I gained valuable experience working with C#, ASP.NET MVC, Boostrap,
jQuery, Azure DevOps, and more. While at this co-op, I was tasked with maintaining and updating
their application _CRAFTS_, and beginning a new project for a client.

A list of some of the notable things I did at this co-op are:

-   Improving performance of pages by upwards of 300%
-   Performed bug fixes and optimizations to features as needed
-   Integrating the Microsoft Graph API to streamline the legacy emailing system

## Other Information

When I'm not programming, I enjoy spending my time playing fun and competitive video
games (fun fact, I used to play for Fanshawe's Esports team). I also love keeping
up with the latest news about sports, my favourite being hockey!
