Hello, my name is Brenden Kohut, I am an aspiring Full-stack developer, based in
Ontario, Canada. I am a recent graduate of Fanshawe College for
an advanced diploma in Computer Programming and Analysis. I am a hard-working and
high-drive individual who loves to learn and improve my programming abilities.

Throughout my time at Fanshawe College, I have learned various programming languages,
frameworks and tools, and have also built up my soft skills such as complex
problem solving, time management, etc. Here is a list of some of my strongest skills.
