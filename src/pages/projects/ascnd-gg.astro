    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Ascnd GG is a personal passion project that I am creating to allow for
      people to host and compete in Esport events without the hassle and
      difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my time at Fanshawe College, I played for the Fanshawe Fuel, the
      Fanshawe Student Union’s Esports team. I had the opportunity to use
      various platforms and from my own experience and other's opinions, none of
      them had all of the features that a lot of players and staff wanted. This
      included things such as advanced player statistics, integrated banning
      system for maps, and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      I hope to create a simple, modernized to use application that will include
      all of the features that these players and staff want, all while being
      easy and stress-free to use.
