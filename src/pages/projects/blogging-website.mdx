## _This application is a work in progress_

<h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-8">Summary</h2>

Blogging Site CMS is a full-stack application that will allow users to create and
manage their own blog posts. It provides a Markdown editor that allows users to
nicely format their posts and upload their own images. It includes features such as
Authentication and Authorization, Post Management, Responsive Design, Browsing and
searching using tags and categories.

The goal of this project for me was to build an application using the most up-to-date
tools that could give me insight into real application development. I wanted this
application to have full testing, including E2E testing using Cypress, unit tests
for the server, etc. and use industry-standard tools and techniques.
