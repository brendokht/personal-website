    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Cacatua was a capstone project for my Managing Software Projects class. It
      is a desktop application for project management, combining team
      communication and project management tools into one.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a group project where we had to come up with a unique idea for a
      project, and create a Vision Document for it, brainstorming things like
      features, target market, competitors, and more. We had to incorporate
      Agile methodologies while we created the project, in the form of sprints
      with tasks and sub-tasks.
