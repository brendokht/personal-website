    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Chat System was the final project for my Advanced Mobile Development
      class. It is a simple Android application where you can create an account,
      add your friends, and message them in real time.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a group project where we were required to incorporate concepts
      learned throughout the span of the class, such as MVVM, coroutines,
      Firebase, etc.
