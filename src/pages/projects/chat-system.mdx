<h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-8">Summary</h2>

This android application was the final project for my advanced mobile development class. This
was a group project, where we were tasked with coming up with an idea for an application, and
we had to incorporate things we learned throughout the semester into it. This included Firestore,
coroutines, MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel), and more. We decided to build a messaging application,
with the ability to create an account, choose a user name and add your friends to be able to chat
with them in real time, using Firestore's snapshots
