## Summary

This mobile app was part of a school project where I had to create an app of my own idea.
using _React Native_ and _Expo_. The purpose of this application is to allow users to
message or email several users with the same message without having to use groups chats.
Users can create an accountm, sign in, and change their profile details. They can then proceed
to import their contacts from their phone and proceed to send messages or emails as they
please.
