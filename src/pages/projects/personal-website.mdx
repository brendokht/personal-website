## Summary

This is the website you are currently on! I decided to create this from scratch using Astro, as
I wanted to learn a web framework I could use in the future for any projects I may create. This
was also the first project I used Tailwind CSS in, which I have loved using and even incorporated
it into my school projects when possible.
