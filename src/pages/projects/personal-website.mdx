<h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-8">Summary</h2>

This is the website you are currently on! Originally, this website was made with just
basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript, however I wanted to learn a _Static Site Generator_ (SSG),
I considered learned other SSGs such as Next.js, Gatsby, etc. however I ultimitely decided to
learn Astro. I also decided to learn Tailwind CSS, which has been amazing and I have
found it super convienient opposed to writing tons of CSS.
